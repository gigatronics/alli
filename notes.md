## class selection: a long list of programs, but only a few are active during in june: open studio, parklot art.. craft kit of $10... looking at the calendar.. july is full, august is empty?! 

## @ marianne 
- has the membership fee changed over the years? does two amounts make sense?  
- any particular reason the pottery classes are $496 or $408?  

## todo: 
- research competitor's website! 
- ?? 
- levels?  beginner, improving, living artist.. 
- commitments? 
- 1 yr long resident program offer accessibility to jewelry / kiln... self guided!.. fellowship for them to connect with previous residents people.
- art in the park - 80 participatns - any or all medium 

## suggestions: 
- is there any payment plan?  
- do you allow people to sign up half way through the program? 
- make the donation page simpler? make a regular donation of small amounts? 
- microgrants? 
- where's jewelry class? metal smithing 
- studio cost? capital cost?
